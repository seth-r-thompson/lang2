# lang2 is a constructed language project

This project is a constructed language, or *conlang*, that I design for fun. It's meant as a sort of artwork, and I have no grander plan than to engage myself with linguistics and language learning, fields I enjoy.

Although this project is a hobby, I host it here publically mainly for easy sharing with anyone interested. And as a bonus it demonstrates that I know a bit of LaTeX.

In this repository you can find:
- the *tex* files I use to compile the reference grammar
- a version of the Libertinus Sans font family that I modified to support more unicode characters
- a version of the [kaobook class](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook) that I modified slightly to support my use case
