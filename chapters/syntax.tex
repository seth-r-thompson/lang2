\chapter{Clauses}
Although the base-generated word order in \langname{} is SVO, this order rarely surfaces due to aggressive focus fronting. The most proximal, most newsworthy information is placed in the front of an utterance in first position. As a consequence, \langname{} is V2 order, mandating that a finite verb always be in second position. Adjuncts, including demoted verbal constructions, typically come after the core arguments of the verb. \marginnote{In practice, the most common word order in declarative sentences is SXOV or VXOS.} Often, however, the order of elements in a clause is determined by focality and evidentiality.

\section{Fronting}
The most likely phrases to be fronted are proximal or directly evident noun phrases,\marginnote{Often, the fronted element will be the conversational focus.} followed by distal or indirectly evident noun phrases. Generic noun phrases are rarely fronted except in fixed constructions.

\langname{} doesn't have explicit role-marking, so it's not always clear if a fronted noun phrase is subject or object. Various structures, including verb agreement and passives, help provided redundancy when context is not enough.

\section{Extraposition}
When a content-heavy phrase needs to be fronted, a dummy noun is often used to allow right-branching extraposition. The dummy noun is lexically dependent, but the generic nouns \rz{lar} or \rz{manc} can also be used, although they may sound stilted for some verbs.
