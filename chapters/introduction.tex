\chapter{Background}
\section{Origins}
\langname{} is an \emph{a priori} artlang originally conceived to fulfill a speedlang challenge, then modified to handle a relay, then finally molded into its own project. Although I had no clear motivations in mind when beginning it, I found that the confluence of random decisions---the Gleb-generated inventory, challenge stipulations, the early translation choices---made the project into something I really enjoyed.

\section{Goals}
The overarching goal is to create something that is cool to me. The project is meant to be naturalistic, but when naturalism conflicts with aesthetic, aesthetic will be prioritized.

A primary way to grow this language and develop new ideas will be through translation of poetry and scientific journals. I hope that these will push the limits of my syntactical rules while also developing an interesting corpus. I'll also try to use \tsc{5moyd}s and hopefully at some point a journal to expand my ability to speak the language and get an intuitive sense for what constructions it prefers.

As I develop this conlang, my goals will be to explore analytic constructions and syntactic minutiae, write in-depth documentation of how information structure manifests in the language, and produce a robust dictionary and corpus.

\section{Lore}
\langname{} is set in a worldbuilding project I create as a hobby. The language is an isolate spoken on the eastern coast of a peninsula, once the language of city-states and now a common language throughout a number of coastal countries. It is heavily influenced by East Cape, the \emph{de jure} language of the peninsula, and other languages of trade. The world the speakers know is analogous to our 1930s.

\chapter{Overview}
\section{Typology}
\langname{} is largely head-initial: verb phrases are broadly verb-object, noun phrases noun-modifier, and prepositional phrases preposition-complement. This pattern holds rather consistently throughout the language, but there are some exceptions, most notably a prominent focus-fronting system.\marginnote{Focus fronting is discussed further in §\ref{sec:fronting}}

There are five total word classes in \langname{}. Most content words are nouns and verbs, but there is a small, closed set of adjectives. Function words are prepositions and particles.

\section{Syntax}
A basic intransitive clause in \langname{} is composed of a subject followed by a predicate.  

\begin{examples}
    \baarucols2
    \ex
        \script Kanyi hec.
        \bits Kanyi hec
        \gloss Kanyi {is there}
        \tr It's Kanyi.
    \ex
        \script Mavan tahęci.
        \bits mavan tahęci
        \gloss {the cat} stretches
        \tr The cat's stretching.
\end{examples}

In a neutral transitive clause, the object follows the verb. Any other dependents are also typically after the object, as in (\ref{ex:word_order_adjunct}).

\begin{examples}
    \ex
        \script Nassoin kąsteci kagesan.
        \bits nassoin kąsteci kagesan
        \gloss {the king} leads {the army}
        \tr The king leads the army.
    \ex \label{ex:word_order_adjunct}
        \script Lalan kiraysi sapan h-tesan.
        \bits lalan kiraysi sapan ah=tesan
        \gloss auntie {looks for} {the dog} on={the beach}
        \tr Auntie's looking for the dog on the beach.
\end{examples}

In some clauses that are more grammatically or informationally marked, other orders are found. Such orders are discussed further in §\ref{sec:fronting}.

\section{Morphology}
Nouns inflect for number and evidence.\marginnote{The pragmatics of nominal evidentiality are discussed in §\ref{sec:evidence}.} Although the generic singular is the citation form, the direct evidence form is the most common in spoken or written corpuses.

% Direct evidence is marked with the suffix -\rz{n}. Indirect evidence is marked by shifting stress to the final syllable. The plural is marked with the suffix -\rz{zr}.

\begin{table}[h] \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
        \toprule
        & \bf Generic & \bf Direct & \bf Indirect \\
        \midrule
        \bf \sc sg & \it\rzc metka & \it\rzc metkan & \it\rzc matkó \\
        \bf \sc pl & \it\rzc matkozr & \it\rzc matkoznr & \it\rzc metkazŕ \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Inflection of \rz{metka} “bowl”}
    \label{tab:inflect_noun}
\end{table}

Modifiers agree with their head nouns for evidence. This includes adjectives (like \rz{ócaa}), appositive nouns (like \rz{mulkas}), and pronouns (like \rz{rat}).

\begin{example}
    \script mavá ocaá mulkás rát
    \bits mavá ocaá mulkás rát
    \gloss cat:UN tall:UN fur:UN me:UN
    \tr my skinny fuzzy cat (I haven't met yet)
\end{example}

Verbs inflect for person of subjects and objects. They also agree with the evidence of the subject.\marginnote[*-1]{The rules governing verbal marking are discussed in §\ref{sec:person_agreement} and §\ref{sec:evidence_agreement}.}

\begin{table}[h] \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
        \toprule
        & \bf Generic & \bf Proximal & \bf Distal \\
        \midrule
        \bf \sc 1.ag & \it\rzc kąstetr & \it\rzc kąstetri & \it\rzc kęstatŕ \\
        \bf \sc 1.pt & \it\rzc kąstetrs & \it\rzc kąstetrci & \it\rzc kąstetŕs \\
        \bf \sc 2 & \it\rzc kąsteta & \it\rzc kęstatai & \it\rzc kęstatá \\
        \bf \sc 3c & \it\rzc kęstac & \it\rzc kąsteci & \it\rzc kęstatés \\
        \bf \sc 3n & \it\rzc kęstacz & \it\rzc kąsteczi & \it\rzc kęstatóz \\
        \bf \sc 3n:1 & \it\rzc kąstetns & \it\rzc kęstatnsi & \it\rzc kęstatńs \\
        \bf \sc refl & \it\rzc kąstetak & \it\rzc kąstetki & \it\rzc kęstaták \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Inflection of \rz{kęstat} “lead”}
    \label{tab:inflect_verb}
\end{table}

There are also two nonfinite verb forms, the bare infinitive and the participle. The infinitive is more noun-like, while the participle is more adverb-like.

\begin{table}[h] \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
        \toprule
        \bf Bare & \bf Participle \\
        \midrule
        \it\rzc kęstat & \it\rzc kąstettal \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Nonfinite forms of \rz{kęstat} “lead”}
    \label{tab:inflect_verb_nonfinite}
\end{table}

Both nominal and verbal marking patterns are largely agglunative, but surface forms may not always resemble their lemma due to morphophonological processes.
