\chapter{Background}
\section{Origins}
\langname{} is an \emph{a priori} artlang originally conceived to fulfill a speedlang challenge, then modified to handle a relay, then finally molded into its own project. Although I had no clear motivations in mind when beginning it, I found that the confluence of random decisions---the Gleb-generated inventory, challenge stipulations, the early translation choices---made the project into something I really enjoyed.

\section{Goals}
The overarching goal is to create something that is cool to me. The project is meant to be naturalistic, but when naturalism conflicts with aesthetic, aesthetic will be prioritized.

A primary way to grow this language and develop new ideas will be through translation of poetry and scientific journals. I hope that these will push the limits of my syntactical rules while also developing an interesting corpus. I'll also try to use \tsc{5moyd}s and hopefully at some point a journal to expand my ability to speak the language and get an intuitive sense for what constructions it prefers.

As I develop this conlang, my goals will be to explore analytic constructions and syntactic minutiae, write in-depth documentation of how information structure manifests in the language, and produce a robust dictionary and corpus.

\section{Lore}
\langname{} is set in a worldbuilding project I create as a hobby. The language is an isolate spoken on the eastern coast of a peninsula, once the language of city-states and now a common language throughout a number of coastal countries. It is heavily influenced by East Cape, the \emph{de jure} language of the peninsula, and other languages of trade. The world the speakers know is analogous to our 1930s.

\chapter{Overview}
\section{Typology}
\langname{} is largely head-initial: verb phrases are broadly verb-object, noun phrases noun-modifier, and prepositional phrases preposition-complement. This pattern holds rather consistently throughout the language, but there are some exceptions, most notably a prominent focus-fronting system.\marginnote{Focus fronting is discussed further in §...}

There are five total word classes in \langname{}. Most content words are nouns and verbs, but there is a small, closed set of adjectives. Function words are prepositions and particles.

\section{Syntax}
A basic intransitive clause in \langname{} is composed of a subject followed by a predicate.  

\begin{examples}
    \baarucols2
    \ex
        \script Kanyi hec.
        \bits Kanyi hec
        \gloss Kanyi {is there}
        \tr It's Kanyi.
    \ex
        \script Mavan tahęci.
        \bits mavan tahęci
        \gloss {the cat} stretches
        \tr The cat's stretching.
\end{examples}

In a neutral transitive clause, the object follows the verb. Any other dependents are also typically after the object, as in (\ref{ex:word_order_adjunct}).

\begin{examples}
    \ex
        \script Nassoin kąsteci kagesan.
        \bits nassoin kąsteci kagesan
        \gloss {the king} leads {the army}
        \tr The king leads the army.
    \ex \label{ex:word_order_adjunct}
        \script Lalan kiraysi sapan h-tesan.
        \bits lalan kiraysi sapan ah=tesan
        \gloss auntie {looks for} {the dog} on={the beach}
        \tr Auntie's looking for the dog on the beach.
\end{examples}

In some clauses that are more grammatically or informationally marked, other orders are found. Such orders are discussed further in §...

\section{Morphology}

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=\sc todo:]
    Need to finalize the morphological forms etc etc. The main thing is figuring out stress patterns; might need to do some dreaded diachronics.
\end{kaobox}

Nouns inflect for number and deixis.\marginnote{Deixis is perhaps better characterized as nominal evidentiality; see §\ref{sec:deixis}.} Although the generic singular is the citation form, the proximal form is the most common in spoken or written corpuses.

\begin{table}[h] \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
        \toprule
        & \bf Generic & \bf Proximal & \bf Distal \\
        \midrule
        \bf \sc sg & \it\rzc metka & \it\rzc metkan & \it\rzc matkó \\
        \bf \sc pl & \it\rzc matkozr & \it\rzc matkonzr & \it\rzc metkazŕ \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Inflection of \rz{metka} “bowl”}
    \label{tab:inflect_noun}
\end{table}

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=\sc todo:]
    Maybe the plural is some sort of clitic, too...
    Attaching at right edge of phrase, and after stuff like -\rz{n}, but still phonologically part of the word, so it gets distal stress.
    
    Or -\rz{n} attaches right after root---harder to diachronically justify, unless the plural is newer than the agreement. Maybe the plural is some kinda circumfix? -\rz{z} + -\rz{r}, where -\rz{n} attaches between?
\end{kaobox}

Modifiers agree with their head nouns for deixis. This includes adjectives (like \rz{ócaa}), appositive nouns (like \rz{mulkas}), and pronouns (like \rz{rat}).

\begin{example}
    \script mavá ocaá mulkás rát
    \bits mavá ocaá mulkás rát
    \gloss cat\tbs\tsc{dist} tall\tbs\tsc{dist} fur\tbs\tsc{dist} me\tbs\tsc{dist}
    \tr my big fuzzy cat (I haven't met yet)
\end{example}

Verbs inflect for person and deictic agreement.

    Not sure if I like the initial stress for generic forms; maybe they just have regular stress rules.

There are also two nonfinite forms, the bare infinitive and the converb.
