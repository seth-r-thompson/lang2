\chapter{Lexicon}
A \langname{}-to-English dictionary is provided below.

\section*{How to use}
Entries for lexical items are listed by their spelling in generic form, ignoring morphophonological alterations. Derived words are listed as separate entries, but their source word is given. On the other hand, idiomatic or fixed expressions are given under the lexical item.

Each sense of a word has three basic parts: a quick, single-word translation for ease-of-use; a more detailed explanation of the concept; and an example sentence. The sentences are usually designed to help the reader figure the word's meaning out from context, particularly for \langname{} speakers and learners.

Pronunciations are given dictionary-style in a phonetic alphabet more intuitive to native \langname{} speakers. See §\ref{ch:segments} for more about the sounds of \langname{} and their transcriptions.
