\chapter{Nouns}
The \langname{} noun phrase is largely analytic, but nouns do inflect for deixis and number. Nouns have three broad inflection patterns, largely related to the way they inflect for plurality.

\section{Stems}
Nouns are broadly divided into three stems based on their inflectional patterns: \emph{vocalic}, \emph{\rz{s}-stems}, and \emph{\rz{r}-stems}. Rarely noun stems will end in other consonants, but these have no discernible shared patterns and often comprise newer loans.

Most noun stems are vocalic stems; typically these end in mid vowels, although some do end in a high vowel. Vocalic stems are usually common gender, excluding loanwords, which are prescriptively assigned neuter gender even if they end in a vowel. 

Neuter nouns, on the other hand, are often either \rz{r}-stems or \rz{s}-stems, the latter being more common. \marginnote{\rz{S}-stems can end in any sibilant, typically \rz{-s} but also \rz{-c} or \rz{-z}.} Although no longer morphologically productive, the endings on \rz{s}-stems and \rz{r}-stems derive from historical derivation processes. Many roots are reflected in both endings, but the shared meaning between them is not always transparent.

\subsection{Vocalic stems}
Vocalic stems have fairly regular, agglunative inflection patterns. However, the proximal plural is shortened to \rz{-rran} for most speakers.

\begin{table}[h] \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
        \toprule
        & \bf Generic & \bf Proximal & \bf Distal \\
        \midrule
        \bf \sc sg & \it\rzc metka & \it\rzc metkan & \it\rzc matkó \\
        \bf \sc pl & \it\rzc matkozar & \it\rzc matkorran & \it\rzc matkazár \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Inflection of vowel-stem \rz{metka} “bowl”}
    \label{tab:metka_inflection}
\end{table}

All vocalic forms share the same endings, but many will have an unpredictable final vowel due to stress-based mid vowel neutralization. There is no way to predict the final vowel from the uninflected lemma, so learners often resort to memorization.

\subsection{Neuter stems}
Neuter stems share a common inflection pattern. For both neuter stems, the proximal surfaces as /on/ instead of /n/. The proximal plural also shortens for neuter stems, but takes the form \rz{-zza-}, influenced by the assibilation morphophonological process. The shared plural form for both stems can create homophones.\marginnote[*-2]{Some strategies to resolve homophones are covered in §\ref{subsec:additive_plural}.}

\section{Deixis}
Nominal deixis has a variety of uses, including evidentiality, distance, familiarity, and topicality.\marginnote{I had this idea, then found out that, as usual, a natural language had it first. Read \href{http://lingpapers.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2020/07/11_ICSNL55_Huijsmans_Reisinger_Matthewson_final.pdf}{Huijsmans, Reisinger, and Matthewson (2020)} for more about the Salishan languages.} Verbs and adjectives exhibit agreement for deictic reference. There are three deictic categories: \emph{generic}, \emph{proximal}, and \emph{distal}.

\subsection{Generic}
The unmarked or dictionary form of a noun is used when the noun is widely understood or well-known, for immaterial referents that cannot be deictically located, or if evidence of the referent is not known. If direct or reported evidence exists, it's infelicitous or questionably grammatical to use unmarked form.

\subsection{Proximal}
The proximal form of a noun is used when the speaker is certain, nearby, or familiar with the noun.
%It can also be used for the conversational topic.
This form most commonly denotes direct evidence, meaning the speaker has personal experience with the marked noun. It is marked with the suffix \rz{-n}. \marginnote[*-2]{\rz{-n} is morphophonemically ⫽on⫽, where ⫽o⫽ doesn't surface for vocalic stems.}

\paragraph{Direct evidence}
The canonical meaning of the proximal form is direct evidence, often translated as “I saw.” 

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=\sc todo:]
    The definiteness constructions probably need to be reworked to square better with (a) the stuff I've learned about definiteness and (b) the use of the deictic forms for topic/focus.
\end{kaobox}

\paragraph{Definiteness}
Proximal forms can be used to describe the definiteness of a referent. This construction is only used for weak, uniqueness-based definiteness (eg. “the Moon”), never for strong, anaphoric definiteness (eg. “the book”). For strong definitess, the noun \rz{sin} “???” is used alongside distal form, as in (\nextx b).

    \endgl
\end{gloss*}

\subsection{Distal}
The distal form of a noun is used when the speaker is uncertain, far, or unfamiliar with the noun. 
%It can also be used for the conversational focus.
This form typically denotes indirect evidence, including inference, meaning the speaker has heard of or can make an educated guess about the existence of the marked noun. Reported deixis is marked by shifting stress to the ultimate syllable of the word.

\paragraph{Indirect Evidence}
The prototypical meaning of the distal form is indirect evidence, often translated as “heard about” or “they said.” As in (\nextx), this evidence is encoded into the clause via the subject and the predicate that agrees with it.

    \endgl
\end{gloss*}

\section{Number}
Nouns inflect morphologically for an additive plural, but there is also a syntactic construction used to form associative plurals. The unmarked form of a noun encodes expected number, \eg \rz{parsa} “eyes” which defaults to a pair and must be modified by a numeral or apposotive to specify a singulative. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{same_vases.jpg}
        \caption{\rz{matkozar}}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}

        \caption{\rz{ezzu metka}}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Additive vs. associative plurals}
\end{figure}

The primary difference in the two plurals is the composition of the set: additive plurals refer to largely homogenous referents, whereas associative plurals refer to largely heterogenous referents.

\subsection{Additive plurals} \label{subsec:additive_plural}
Additive plurals are used for a set of homogenous referents and never heterogenous referents; \eg \rz{matkozar} is “a set of the same (or similar) bowl” and never “a set of diverse bowls.”\marginnote{The second meaning would use the associative plural.}

Additive plurality is indicated through the suffix \rz{-zar}. Morphological marking is optional and a noun can be inferred additively plural from context. \marginnote{Mandatory plural marking is stylistically preferred in formal contexts.} As such marking is less common for small, discrete or easily countable sets or when a referent has been established plural in prior conversation. However, speakers are not always consistent with marking.

Morphonologically, plural marking can be thought to precede deictic marking; plural distal nouns have accent placed on the plural suffix. As seen in Table \ref{tab:metka_inflection}, \rz{matkozar} becomes \rz{matkazár}, not \rz{*matkózar}.

\paragraph{Combating homophony}
Because the suffixes of \rz{s}-stems and \rz{r}-stems merge in the plural, some minimal pairs are rendered homphones when inflected. To combat this, speakers sometimes employ \rz{tevi} “many” as an appositive modifier for the singular form.

\paragraph{Explicit number}
When number is specified with a numeral, the noun is not marked for plurality, as in (\nextx). This can also be used as another strategy to combat homophony.

\begin{gloss}
    \begingl
        \glpreamble vęci ocza \endpreamble
            vęci[mercenary]
            ocza[two]
        \glft “two mercenaries”
        \trailingcitation (cf. \rz{vącizar} “mercenaries”)
    \endgl
\end{gloss}

\subsection{Associative plurals}
Unlike the additive plural, the associative plural is not marked morphologically; it is nonetheless rather prevalent. The preposition \rz{ezzu} conveys the associative meaning.\marginnote{Like \rz{su}, \rz{ezzu} can appear stranded. See §\ref{subsec:u_and_su}.}

The associative is used for a set of heterogenous referents. For animate (especially human) referents, the meaning is canoncically “a person and their associates,” as in (\nextx). The focal referent\marginnote{Terminology in this section adapted from \href{https://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~h2816i3x/Lehre/2007_VL_Typologie/03_Daniel_AssociativePlural.pdf}{Daniel and Moravcsik (2007)}.} (\ie most important) is the marked noun.

\begin{gloss}
    \begingl
        \glpreamble Sayanarnat otik ezzu Kanyi ez-laran. \endpreamble
            sayenar-nat[be.ignorant-\tsc{cvb}]
            ot-ik[be-\tsc{prox}]
            ezzu[\tsc{assoc}]
            Kanyi[\tsc{name}]
            ez=lar-n[\tsc{prep=expl-prox}]
        \glft “For this, Kanyi and his friends won't be much \emph{help}.”
    \endgl
\end{gloss}

However, the associative can also have a number of idiomatic, context-specific meanings, usually referring to diverse groups.

% \pex 
% \a \begingl
% \glpreamble ezzu Akakvazi rematt \endpreamble
% \glft “The diverse group of tag players entertained us ...”
% \endgl 
% % \a \begingl
% % \glft “My grandfather painted a wide variety of paintings.”
% % \endgl
% \xe

\section{Gender}
Although nouns traditionally distinguish \emph{common} and \emph{neuter} gender, this has largely become a prescriptive convention. \marginnote{The gender distinction is more common in literature or academia.} Loanwords, especially technical loanwords, are typically assigned neuter gender. Some words only distinguish gender for certain uses or contexts, thus dictionaries typically denote if a given usage is expected to require neuter gender.

\section{Apposition}
Apposition is fairly common due to the small adjective class present in \langname{}. Apposition is used in a number of collocative constructions but is distinct from compounding largely because of stress patterns and morphophonological processes.\marginnote{Compounds can shift stress and also show cross-morpheme sound changes.} Furthermore, appositive nouns shown agreement with the noun they modify, like adjectives.

\subsection{Inalienable possession}
Apposition is a fairly common strategy for possession of all types,\marginnote{Alienable possession via apposition is dispreferred in formal registers.} but inalienably possessed nouns require apposition, as in (\nextx b).

\begin{gloss}
    \a \ljudge{?} \begingl 
        \glpreamble  hora im-kęsa \endpreamble
        hora[wrist]
        im=kęsa[of=soldier]
        \glft \textit{Intended:} “soldier's wrist”
    \endgl
    \a \begingl 
        \glpreamble hora kęsa \endpreamble
        hora[wrist]
        kęsa[soldier]
        \glft “soldier's wrist”
    \endgl
\end{gloss}

The sentence in (\lastx a) more readily lends itself to a reading indicating inalienable possession, such as “soldier's craftmanship” or “soldier's weaponsmithing.”

\subsection{Reducing syntactic complexity}
Appositives are also used as a way of combating heaviness in complex noun phrases. This often occurs in noun phrases with multiple prepositional modifiers, especially when one of the modifiers is \rz{im} “of.” Other prepositions can be reduced this way as well. 

When multiple prepositional phrases modify a head noun the phrase is syntactically heavy. For example (\nextx) has three modifiers, an adjective and two prepositional phrases, one with its own adjective.

\begin{gloss*}
    \begingl
        \glpreamble rat Hecik pakné taá im-lalasan ez-helazzaran acoan. \endpreamble
        rat[I]
        hecik[be.at]
        pakné[house\tbs\tsc{dist}]
        taá[blue\tbs\tsc{dist}]
        im=lalasa-n[of=auntie-\tsc{prox}]
        ez=helazzaran[\tsc{prep}=mountains]
        acoan[tall]
        \glft “I'll be at auntie's blue house near the tall mountains.”
    \endgl
\end{gloss*}

To reduce the syntactic load of the sentence, a speaker might instead render it as (\nextx). The phrase is clearly appositional; \rz{lalasa} switches from proximal marking (indicating the speaker has met her) to distal marking (to agree with its head noun). 

\begin{gloss*}
    \begingl
        \glpreamble rat Hecik pakné taá lalasá ez-helazzaran acoan. \endpreamble
        rat[I]
        hecik[be.at]
        pakné[house\tbs\tsc{dist}]
        taá[blue\tbs\tsc{dist}]
        lalasá[auntie\tbs\tsc{dist}]
        ez=helazzaran[\tsc{prep}=mountains]
        acoan[tall]
        \glft “I'll be at auntie's blue house near the tall mountains.”
    \endgl
\end{gloss*}

The new sentence has fewer function words and less disparate inflections, reducing some of its complexity.

\section{Phrasal syntax}
Noun phrases are predominantly head-initial. Generally speaking, syntactically simpler consituents occur before more syntactically complex ones, as shown in (\nextx).

\begin{gloss}
    head → adjective → number → appositive → prepositional phrase
\end{gloss}

\setchapterpreamble[u]{\margintoc}
\chapter{Pronouns}
Prounouns are morphologically and syntactically similar to other nouns---they share inflectional patterns and can be modified by adjectives. The notable differences are that pronouns rarely inflect for deixis, and some appositive constructions are ungrammatical.

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=\sc todo:]
Settle on pronominal forms---right now it's \rz{rat} \tsc{1}, \rz{a(f)} \tsc{2}, \rz{sec} \tsc{3c}, and \rz{moc} \tsc{3n}. There's some isogloss map about whether \tsc{2} is \rz{a} or \rz{af}.
\end{kaobox}

\paragraph{Possession}
Like nominal possession, pronominal possession can be expressed either through apposition or prepositional phrases. \marginnote{Formal registers prefer the prepositional construction.} Thus both \rz{lar im-sec} and \rz{lar sec} can mean “his thing.” However, apposition is more common in isolation for pronouns than it is for nouns.
